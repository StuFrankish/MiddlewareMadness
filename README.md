# MiddlewareMadness
The goal is to learn about writting good quality middleware, while making use of some of the official .Net 8 (LTS) goodness released very recently.
It looks like a complete mess right now and a good tidy up is coming soon, promise!

Some of the things I'm exploring and using are;
- Primary constructors
- Options API
- Integrating Serilog directly into the middleware
- Custom endpoint routing (find, process and execute multiple registered endpoints)

The Web Application is just a testing ground to test and use my middleware, so you'll find it boring with a side of bland, everything happens in the ApiMiddleware project.
