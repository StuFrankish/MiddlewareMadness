# MiddlewareMadness
The goal is to learn about writting good quality middleware, while making use of some of the official .Net 8 (LTS) goodness released very recently.
My secondary goal is to take what I learn here and build a more complete solution based around a fictious accounting application.

Some of the things I'm exploring and using are;
- Custom endpoint routing (find, process and execute multiple registered endpoints)
- Integrating Serilog directly into the middleware
- Embedding a UI framework

The Web Application is just a testing ground to test and use my middleware, so you'll find it boring with a side of bland, everything happens in the ApiMiddleware project.
